# What it is?

The aim of this app is to help people with small service companies to manage their clients.
The app is written in Flutter, so it works on both of iOS and Android devices. This is my first project in Dart and I know, that there are some parts of code, that I could write better. 

# How it works?

This app is optimized for printers service companies. You can add a new agreement client or no-agreement client. Then you can display them, add new tasks and enter number of copies. If the number of copies exceeds the „free copies number”, the app counts how much the client have to pay before the next billing period. You can set a billing period for every client and the app reminds you when you should visit client and check the number of copies. All clients are being saved to JSON file, which is synced to Firebase. 
You can also create reports, add tasks and do a lot of other things. Everything is shown on the screenshots below.
